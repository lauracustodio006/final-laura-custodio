For my website enhancement, I created a interactive button that allows readers to execute JavaScript code. This feature makes my article more engaging, This may help the reader to understand better the problem and the code.
The enhancement works by combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each code example includes a button and an output area. When the button is clicked, JavaScript executes the code and displays the results inside a styled `<div>` element. In my FizzBuzz example, the button runs a loop from 1 to 100, printing "Fizz" for numbers divisible by three, "Buzz" for numbers divisible by five, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both. The output is appended to the `<div>` on the webpage. Styling was also an important consideration. I made sure that the text was black and a background that would fit in the website page. 
This enhancement significantly improves the educational purpose of my articles. By implementing this feature, I was able to practice DOM manipulation.
