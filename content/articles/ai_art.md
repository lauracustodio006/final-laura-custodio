Ai nowadays is a very usefull tool that makes the process of creating a website more efficient and smooth. I use AI specially for CSS, because there are so many option that I haven't memorized, so using AI makes my website more coherent and aesthetic. Another use of AI is correcting my grammar in  the aricles; programs like Grammarly or ChatGPT help me a lot in this area. I also use them to adjust my sentence to improve the flow of my writing. 
The last and maybe more important is when I ask AI to help with my coding issues in the enchancement. For example, I’ll describe one conversation I had with AI. Firstly, subnmitted my code that wasn't working- I used another exercice as a base, but it wouldn't run. When I put in ChatGPT, it said I had three issus:
1. The while loop results were going to the console, not my div id="output".
2. My script tag is missing a closing brace } and /script. 
3. To show my results in the page, append to output.innerHTML instead of console.log(). 
After it provided the correct code with the explanaitions. The more important thing that AI helped was the third point, by using output.innerHTLM my reslts were saved and displayed properly. This experience was a goood way for me to lean something new. The others ways I use AI are more for practically, but when it helps with my assignments, it becomes a usefull tool for education.

Here is the link for the conversation for AI that shows my enchacement and the grammar correction for the text above: https://chatgpt.com/share/69346834-94f0-800e-bf3e-a6d140f98991
