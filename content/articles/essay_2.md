## Introduction

Throughout foundation 111 class, we have seen how different authors describe what it means to be human. For my final project, I argue that our understanding of humanity is shaped by the reality we live in. To demonstrate this idea, I created a poster comparing four authors and examining how their lives influenced their ideas about what it means to be human. My analysis begins with Genesis and Enuma Elish, two ancient creation stories, and then moves to the philosophical writings of Xunzi and Mencius. By comparing these authors, I show how experiences, culture, religion, and other factors shape our concept of humanity.

## Creation Stories and the Cultural Understanding of Humanity

The comparison between Enuma Elish and Genesis reveals that the two texts are not only similar in subject matter, but also in structure. As we studied, both creation narratives begin with a watery primordial state, followed by the separation of waters above and below, the creation of land, a source of light, and finally humanity (Reader pp. 3–5).
Despite their structural similarities, their differences stem from the different realities experienced by the Babylonians and the Hebrews. Enuma Elish, written long before Genesis, reflects a world in which ancient peoples relied on myths to “give some coherence and order to a new world that they did not really understand” (Bratcher). The myth reveals a worldview shaped by chaos, shifting politics, and violent gods. In this story, humans are created solely to work for the gods, demonstrating that humanity was viewed as inferior and expendable. The story also served a political purpose, legitimizing Marduk’s kingship and reinforcing Babylonian religious practices, festivals, art, and temples in his honor. As noted, Enuma Elish demonstrates “how powerful myths could be changed to suit the political and cultural needs of a ruling state” (“Enuma Elish or the Babylonian creation epic”).
Genesis presents a different understanding of humanity. Instead of being created to perform labor or maintain divine order, humans are formed to have a relationship with God. Rather than being a “fallout from the activity of the gods” (Bratcher), humanity is described as God’s perfect creation, made in His own image. In Genesis 1:26, God declares: “Let us make humanity in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.” Although Enuma Elish likely influenced Genesis, their ideas about humanity are drastically different: the Babylonians imagine humans as servants of the gods, while the Hebrews represent humans as purposeful beings worthy of divine relationship.

## Confucian Philosophy and Human Nature

A different approach to understanding humanity can be found in the Confucian tradition. Confucianism does not focus on gods or creation stories. Instead, it emphasizes the development of moral character and the maintenance of social harmony (Confucianism). Confucius argued that ethical behavior promotes positive influence in the world, forming cosmic balance.
Mencius believed that human nature is inherently good. He argued that people must be taught to behave badly, using the metaphor of nourishment: “There is nothing that does not grow when it receives its proper nourishment, and there is nothing that does not shrivel when it loses that which it was nourished by” (Reader p. 118). For him, people possess natural moral tendencies and simply require the right environment to flourish.
Xunzi, however, believed that human nature is originally bad. According to him, humans can only become good through conscious effort, self-discipline, and the guidance of sages (Reader p. 120). Even though he disagreed with Mencius, Xunzi still valued moral education; he simply believed that goodness must be created, not discovered.
Their contrasting philosophies may stem from their experiences. Mencius lived during the second half of the Zhou dynasty, a time described as one “of great social and intellectual ferment” (Van Norden). Although instability existed, he experienced relative peace, which may have led to his optimistic view of human nature. Xunzi lived later, in the middle of the Warring States period, a time of widespread conflict and violence. These conditions likely shaped his belief that humans are naturally selfish and must be taught to be good. This comparison demonstrates how life experience influences beliefs about human nature.

## Conclusion: The Reality We Live Shapes the Humanity We See

I chose to address this topic because, like many questions we explored throughout the course, I wanted to find a clear answer to the question: What does it mean to be human? Throughout my study, I found myself agreeing with some authors and questioning others. After analyzing and comparing their works and their lived realities, I believe that what it means to be human cannot be defined universally. Instead, our understanding of humanity is shaped by culture, religion, experience, political environment, and many additional factors. Ultimately, to understand what it means to be human, we must first understand the world in which a person lives.
