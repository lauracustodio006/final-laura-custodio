I used AI in my website for three main purposes:
- The first was in writing content. For the programming blog posts, AI helped me clarify my sentences and correct grammatical errors. This made my explanations more readable and professional.  
- The second use was in my enhancement. When implementing the JavaScript interactive features, I asked AI for help fixing both syntax errors and structural mistakes.  
- The third was in styling. I asked AI to help with my enchancement styling, which made the process more efficient and allowed me to create a consistent look across the site.
